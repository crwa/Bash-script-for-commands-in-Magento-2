# Bash script for commands in Magento 2

This script helps you developer gain time in running recurring code during a Magento 2 development.

Bash: Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.

The deploy.sh file was built for the main and most commonly used command lines in Magento 2 needs during its development. It is noteworthy that the construction of this script was based on the execution of scripts for Magento production mode.

Every time you make a theme update, install a module, or other modifications that affect both database and static content, we simply run this script and all necessary commands will be executed in queue.

To execute the deploy.sh file simply start the command with bash followed by the file name.
